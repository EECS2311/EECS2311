# Running the Project
**This project was developed using Java 17.**

1. Pull this project repository.
2. Create an info.java file within the database package.
Initialize the class as such.
```java
package database;
public class info {

	public static String dbName = "";
	public static String dbUser = "";
	public static String dbPass = "";
	public static String url = "";

}
```
3. `RecipeApiClient` uses gson 2.10.1 contained in `lib` folder. It is an external library that does JSON parsing. You will need to add this jar file to your build path (Eclipse) or project structure (IntelliJ).
4. Run the the following queries that are located in the database package... DB_drop.sql > DB_init.sql > DB_populate.sql (in this order)
5. Install JDBC for postgreSQL and put it on your buildpath.
6. src/gui/HomeView -> Run
